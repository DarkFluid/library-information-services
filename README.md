# LibraryInformationServices

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `json-server --watch db.json` in order to launch the database. (You'll need to have json-server installed globally since I haven't added it).

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
